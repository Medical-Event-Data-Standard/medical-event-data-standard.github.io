# MEDS Ecosystem Core Tutorial Notebooks

In this directory, we store the raw jupyter notebooks that serve as the tutorials we display on the website.
You can run these notebooks locally to play with the tutorials in action or via Google Colab.

To install dependencies to run them locally, run the below code _from this directory_:

```bash
# Optional: Create a conda environment; alternatively, you can use a pip venv
conda create -n MEDS_tutorials python=3.12
conda activate MEDS_tutorials

# Install dependencies
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

Then, you can run the notebooks via `jupyter notebook` and navigate to the desired notebook.
