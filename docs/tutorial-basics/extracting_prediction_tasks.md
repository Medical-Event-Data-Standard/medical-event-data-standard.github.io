# Extracting a Prediction Task Cohort from MEDS Data

To easily extract prediction tasks from MEDS Data, you can use the
[ACES](https://eventstreamaces.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package. This package allows you to define simple
configuration files that specify the inclusion/exclusion criteria for tasks you want to extract and have them
be automatically extractable from MEDS data via a command line interface.

See the [ACES documentation](https://eventstreamaces.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or the dedicated ACES task
extraction tutorial in [MEDS-DEV](https://github.com/mmcdermott/MEDS-DEV/blob/demo/demo/aces.ipynb) for more
information on how to use the package.
