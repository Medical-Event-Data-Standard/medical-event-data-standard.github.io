# Pre-processing MEDS Data

To pre-process MEDS data, you can use a variety of tools and libraries. The
[MEDS-Reader](https://meds-reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library will help you do fast, pythonic, and
efficient processing over MEDS datasets with familiar syntax, enabling you to write your own pipelines as you
would normally but with significant acceleration.

You can also leverage tools like [MEDS-Transforms](https://github.com/mmcdermott/MEDS_transforms) to build
pipelines across existing or customized stages of pre-processing, such as outlier detection, normalization,
event and/or measurement filtering, and more.
