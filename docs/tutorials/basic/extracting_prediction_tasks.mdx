# Extracting a Prediction Task Cohort from MEDS Data

To easily extract prediction tasks from MEDS Data, we will use the
[ACES](https://github.com/justin13601/aces/) package. This package allows you to define simple
configuration files that specify the inclusion/exclusion criteria for tasks you want to extract and have them
be automatically extractable from MEDS data via a command line interface. See the
[ACES documentation](https://eventstreamaces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.

In this tutorial, we'll run an end-to-end extraction of a prediction task from the MIMIC-IV Demo dataset.
